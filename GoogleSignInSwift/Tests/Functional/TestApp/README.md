This application is in place to help test the SwiftUI Google Sign-in button.
Tests are run via an example application, `GoogleSignInSwiftButtonExample`.
These tests rely on an `XCUIApplication` instance that will launch the app.

# Usage

## Testing

Open `GoogleSignInSwiftButtonExample.xcodeproj` and type "command-u" to
execute the tests.

## Running the App

The app isn't very interesting right now; it simply displays an instance of
`GoogleSignInButton` that increments a counter upon tap.
Nonetheless, if you would like to run this app, all you need to do is open
`GoogleSignInSwiftButtonExample.xcodeproj` and hit run.
